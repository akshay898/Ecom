This website is built using the commerce.js api (https://commercejs.com/), where I added the products and cost details, and we can monitor the prices and orders using this api.


I used the Material UI library for ui, which allows us to import and use various components to create a user interface in our React applications.


for the payment processor For sending invoices, accepting payments, managing subscription billing, and editing and managing account information, I used the Stripe API.
